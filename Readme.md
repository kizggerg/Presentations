# Presentations

A collection of technical / career based presentation I have given over the years.

# Setup

> npm install

# Present

For example, to run `soft_skills_for_starters`:

> npm run start:soft_skills

If you are building the presentation as you go along, you can use the watch mode to see updates in real time:

> npm run start:soft_skills:watch
