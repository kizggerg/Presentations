# Balance your Personality

**Are you highly agreeable?**

Seek advice from a disagreeable colleague before moving forward on a design.

**Are you introverted?**

Ask your extraverted boss for help pulling the team together to tackle a challenge.

**Do you sometimes forget little details?**

Pair with a conscientious person during a code review to know what to look out for.
