# Synopsis

Software engineering is more than just writing code. Knowing programming languages, frameworks, tools, algorithms, and design patterns is important, but these skills are only half the battle. Without understanding how to collaborate with others; how to communicate your ideas; or how to have a mindset that sets you up for success, your engineering career is likely to stagnate.

There are 3 truths about becoming truly successful in the industry:

1. Great "hard" skills will get you a great job.
2. Great "soft" skills will get you great opportunities.
3. The combination of BOTH will get you a successful and rewarding engineering career.

We've seen a ton of great talks in this meetup about the "hard" skills needed to level-up in your carrer. This talk will focus on the softer side of things, including:

- What mindset should you develop to build for yourself a meaningful career?
- How do you choose a company that will reward you for the work you put in?
- How can you understand your yourself - your personality, strengths, and weaknessness - to be uniquely valuable to the company you work for?
- How do you go about learning new "hard" skills starting from knowing nothing at all?
- How do you keep moving forward when you feel demoralized with your work?

On top of this, you will have the opportunity to hear advice from other successful engineers about the unique path they took to level-up in their own careers.

By the end of this talk, if you take all of this advice to heart, you will have the right mindset to be unstoppable.
